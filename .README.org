#+Author: Shimmy Xu

An archive of core configuration files for the fabled Bipedal Inter-Galactic Mass Obliteration Device (BIGMOD). A lot of motivations and ideas comes from [[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice][Luke Smith's]] and [[https://github.com/embik/dotfiles][Marvin Beckers']] dotfiles and [[https://suckless.org/rocks/][suckless.org]].
